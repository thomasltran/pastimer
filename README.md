The best Pomodoro Timer periodt.

# Getting Started
Environment installation and setup:
1.) [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows)[^1]
2.) [Adoptium - select Temurin 11 (LTS)](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk11&jvmVariant=hotspot)
3.) Set the JDK and SDK in IntelliJ to the one you just installed
4.) Connect to GitHub and clone this repository
3.) [libGDX guide](http://libgdx.com/dev/import-and-running/)

[^1]. Eclipse probably works as well, but I am using this since the guides are more structured around it.
